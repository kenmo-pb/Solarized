## About

[Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) is a carefully-designed color theme by [Ethan Schoonover](https://ethanschoonover.com/). It has many benefits:

- Reduces *brightness contrast* for reduced eyestrain
- Retains *contrasting hues* for readability
- Unified light and dark modes
- RGB values derived from CIELAB model
- Switching light/dark retains perceived contrast
- Accent colors based off colorwheel rotations
- Designed to handle fonts of various weights

## Installation

Download one or both themes (`.prefs` files), and import them in the IDE:

- Preferences > Import/Export > Load from: (browse) > Open > Include Color settings > Import Settings > Ok

Or, **since PB 6.20**, just copy the `.prefs` files into your `<PureBasic home>/ColorSchemes/` subfolder (and restart the IDE) to add them to the Preferences > Editor > Coloring dropdown list.
